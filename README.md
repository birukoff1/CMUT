# CMUT
Multiphysical model of CMUT array based on modal decomposition and the Rayleigh integral.

Here are two files in the project:
1) CMUT_interface.mlx - a file, dedicated to provide a link berween the user and the model. There is a description of all the functions, its parameters and the model's variables the user can use.
2) CMUT.m - a file, consisting the model itself with the algorithms for calculation of the parameters and visualization of the results.
